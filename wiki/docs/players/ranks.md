# Ranks & Permissions

Create ranks, set permissions, and manage member rank assignments.

## Quick reference

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/g ranks` | `lumaguilds.guild.ranks` | Open the rank management menu. |
| `/g ranks chat on\|off` | `lumaguilds.guild.ranks` + guild settings permission | Show or hide rank labels for everyone in your guild chat. |
| `/g menu` | `lumaguilds.guild.menu` | Open the guild control panel. |

## How it works

Every member is assigned a rank. Ranks have a *priority* (0 = owner, higher numbers = lower rank) and a set of *permissions*. To do anything privileged — invite, kick, manage homes, declare war — your rank needs the matching permission. You can never promote someone to or beyond your own priority, and you can never manage a member who outranks you.

## Opening the rank menu

Use `/g ranks` or `/g menu` → Ranks to access rank management. From there you can create, delete, rename, reorder, and set permissions on ranks.

```text
/g ranks
```

## Creating a rank

In the rank menu, click "Create". Pick a name and assign permissions. New ranks default to the lowest priority — use the reorder buttons to lift them up.

Example: Create a "Moderator" rank with permission to invite and kick members.

## Rank colors and guild chat

When creating or renaming a rank, put color codes in its name: `&aFounder` for green, `&6&lModerator` for bold gold, or `&#55ff99Member` for a hex color. Names may contain 1–24 visible letters, numbers, spaces, underscores, or hyphens; color codes do not count toward that limit. Changing colors keeps the rank's permissions, member assignments, and claim access.

Guild leaders and ranks with **Manage Guild Settings** can show or hide rank labels for the entire guild with `/g ranks chat on` or `/g ranks chat off`. Java players can also use **Guild Chat Ranks** in rank management; Bedrock players can use the toggle in guild settings. Labels are shown by default, and the setting survives server restarts. It changes guild chat only.

## Setting permissions on a rank

Open the rank in the menu and go to Permissions. Toggle each permission to enable or disable it. Permissions are grouped by area:

- **Members:** invite, kick, promote, demote
- **Homes:** create, set, remove, access (restricted homes)
- **Vault:** deposit, withdraw, manage inventory
- **War:** declare, accept, end
- **Banner:** set guild banner/tag colors
- And more.

Only give permissions you trust members to use safely.

## Reordering rank priority

In the rank menu, use the ▲ / ▼ buttons next to each rank to move it up or down. Higher priority = more trust. The owner rank (priority 0) can't move, and you can't move a rank above your own priority.

```text
Owner (priority 0)
  ▼
Moderator (priority 1)
  ▼
Member (priority 2)
```

## Promoting and demoting members

Open `/g menu` → Members. Click a member and select Promote or Demote. Both online and offline members can be managed.

```text
/g menu
```

The system will confirm the action before applying it. You can't promote someone above your own rank, and you can't demote the owner.

## Gotchas

- Mods with "Manage Members" can no longer manage co-owners or promote themselves above their rank (fixed mid-2026).
- Offline kicks now respect priority — you can't kick someone above you just because they're offline.
- Promote/demote confirmations show the real player name even when the target is offline (used to show "Unknown Player").
- The owner role is fixed at priority 0 and has all permissions automatically. You can't create a rank equal to the owner.
- If a member's rank is deleted, they're moved to the next-lowest rank.
