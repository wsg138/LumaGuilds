/**
 * Stable, cross-plugin integration surface for reading LumaGuilds guild data.
 *
 * LumaGuilds registers an implementation in Bukkit's ServicesManager at enable,
 * so consumers (EnthusiaMarket) access it via:
 *
 *     Bukkit.getServicesManager().load(GuildLookup::class.java)
 *
 * This deliberately avoids reaching into LumaGuilds' Koin container from another
 * plugin's classloader: a reified Koin `get<T>()` carries a `kotlin.reflect.KClass`
 * in its signature, and that type resolves to different Class objects across the
 * two plugin classloaders, producing a JVM loader-constraint LinkageError. Every
 * method here uses only JDK types plus [GuildSummary], all loaded from the shared
 * join-classpath, so the boundary is safe.
 *
 * All `permission` strings are [net.lumalyte.lg.domain.entities.RankPermission]
 * enum names (e.g. "EDIT_SHOP_STOCK").
